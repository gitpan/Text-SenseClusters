<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p>This program removes all bigrams from the given BIGRAM file that do not  
include at least one constituent word from the UNIGRAM file. Note that 
this can also be applied on a co-occurrence file.</p>
<p>The intent of this in SenseClusters is to allow a user to significantly 
reduce the number of features in a BIGRAM file by including only those 
that contain at least one word from the test data. In this use case, a 
user would have a BIGRAM file of features found in training data, and 
would also have a UNIGRAM file from a set of test data. The intuition 
behind this is that we know that a bigram made up of words that do not 
occur in the test data will not be needed for creating representations of 
the test data for clustering.</p>
<p>Note that this program DOES NOT adjust the any of the counts as found in 
the BIGRAM file. Thus, the intent of this program is to make it possible 
to reduce the number of features that must be searched through during 
feature matching, for example. However, it is not intended to adjust the 
sample size or counts of bigrams. The counts remain the same, so any 
conclusions drawn from statistic.pl, for example, are not affected by this 
program.</p>

<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>This program is very conservative in what it removes from a 
given set of input bigrams. Just because a unigram occurs 
in the test set of data does not mean that a bigram that 
contains it must occur. So reduce-count.pl very likely
leaves in place some bigrams that do not occur in a given
set of test data. However, it can be applied to bigrams,
co-occurrence and target-co-occurrences equally well,
since it is only looking for a unigram and not an exact
match between bigrams (where order matters).</p>
<p>It must also be remembered that this program was originally 
intended for use with huge-count.pl, a program from the Ngram 
Statistics Package that calculates count information on 
very large corpora. So if you have 1,000,000 different bigrams,
then removing all of those that don't contain a given set of
unigrams drawn from a much smaller sample of test data will
make a very large difference.</p>
<p>It seems like it should be possible to be more aggressive
and find, for example, the intersection of the bigrams found
in training and test data, and reset the features to that.</p>
<p>It also seems like it might be useful to reduce the number
of unigram features in the same way.</p>
<p>This might be replaceable with a simple program that finds
the intersection of features observed in training data and
those that actually exist in the test data.</p>
