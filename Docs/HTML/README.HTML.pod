=over

=item 1. SenseClusters-Code-README.html -
 
A file containing links to the documentation (html version) of all the 
Perl programs present in this package.

=item 2. discriminate.html -

HTML version of the documentation for the wrapper program /SC/discriminate.pl

=item 3. Toolkit_Docs -

This directory contains documentation (html version) for all the Perl programs
present in the /SC/Toolkit directory.

Note: The links to discriminate.pl and all the html files under Toolkit_Docs 
directory are provided by the SenseClusters-Code-README.html file.

=item 4. create_doc.sh -

A Shell script that creates documentation for all the .pl files 
in html format. It creates .html files for SenseClusters' root 
level .pl files and for the .pl's in Toolkit directory under /Toolkit_Docs
output directory.

Usage: create_doc.sh SC_PATH

where SC_PATH is a complete path where SenseClusters resides including
SenseClusters directory name.

=item 5. traverse.sh -

A script internally called from create_doc.sh 

Note: The output files generated by create_doc.sh script 
(intenally also traverse.sh) are already included in the 
distribution and are linked together in SenseClusters-Code-README.html
Thus typically you would not need to execute these scripts.

=item 6. SenseClusters-Code-README.pod -
 
A file containing the basic organization of the SenseClusters-Code-README.html 
file. 

NOTE: Please do not re-create the html version from this pod file 
because then the links to various other html files will have to be manually 
corrected.
