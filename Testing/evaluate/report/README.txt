1. Introduction: 
----------------

This program is a component of a SenseClusters package that reports the 
precision, recall for clustering process and displays confusion table. 
The scripts and files provided here could be used to test the correct 
behaviour of the program and backward compatibility. 

Tests:
======

There are total 17 test scripts in this directory and these test report.pl
for various label and prelabel outputs ...
These test scripts are written in the files testA*.sh.
We have written a single test script normal-op.sh which will run all testA*.sh
for you. Please run normal-op.sh by typing 'normal-op.sh' on the command line.

2. Conclusion:
---------------

We have tested program report.pl and conclude that it runs correctly.
We have also provided the test scripts so that future versions of report.pl 
can be compared to the current version against these scripts.
